## Overview

AI is evolving at breakneck speed, and my relationship with AI development tools has fundamentally changed over the past year. What started as viewing AI as a naive intern has transformed into managing a team of AI agents, where my role has shifted from hands-on coding to strategic oversight and quality assurance. This evolution mirrors many of the career transitions I've experienced over the past 35 years, but compressed into months rather than years.

## The Rapid Evolution of AI Capabilities

If there's one thing I've learned in my decades in technology, it's that the pace of change can be breathtaking. But even by technology standards, AI development has been extraordinary. What you knew about AI capabilities six months ago probably doesn't represent what AI can do today. The introduction of agentic AI tools has been a particularly significant inflection point in this evolution.

Just eighteen months ago, I was skeptical about AI's ability to write meaningful code. The early iterations felt like working with an eager but inexperienced intern - someone who could handle basic tasks but needed constant supervision and often produced code that looked right on the surface but had fundamental flaws underneath. I found myself spending more time reviewing and fixing AI-generated code than I would have spent just writing it myself.

That skepticism led me to maintain a very hands-on approach. I wanted to understand every line of code, every architectural decision, every dependency. I felt responsible for ensuring that I could maintain and extend, or even rewrite, whatever the AI produced. In retrospect, this was probably the right approach at the time, but it's no longer the most effective way to work with modern agentic AI systems.

## A New Role: From Coder to Team Lead

Today, my relationship with AI has fundamentally shifted. Instead of viewing AI as an intern that I need to constantly supervise, I now approach it more like managing a development team where I serve as the technical lead or development manager. I spend very little time writing code myself, and much more time setting direction, reviewing output, and providing feedback to improve quality and ensure we're working on the right problems.

This transition wasn't immediate, and it required me to let go of some deeply ingrained habits. For most of my early career, I was a hands-on developer who believed that understanding every detail of the codebase was essential for effective leadership. As I moved into leadership roles, my time in the code decreased significantly and I focused on ensuring that my team was aligned and productive and that we were delivering value to our users. With agentic AI my relationship to the tooling has mirrored my own career path, I've learned to focus more on setting clear requirements, establishing quality standards, and providing architectural guidance while trusting my team to handle the implementation details. Whether my team consists of human developers, AI agents, the principles of effective sofware development leadership remain the same.

The role feels remarkably similar to managing human developers, with a few key differences. AI agents don't have egos, they don't get frustrated with feedback, and they can work around the clock. But like human developers, they benefit from clear direction, consistent standards, and regular feedback loops: and on some occasions, I may still need to step in and provide the low level, detailed instructions when the team members (or AI agents) are struggling with a particularly complex problem.

## Embracing Imperfection

One of the biggest mental shifts I've had to make is accepting that AI-generated code doesn't need to be perfect, and more importantly, it doesn't need to be exactly how I would have written it. This realization came after a year or two of holding AI to an impossibly high standard - one that I couldn't even meet myself.

Every developer since the inception of computers has created imperfect software. Bugs are simply part of our development experience, and we've built entire industries around testing, monitoring, and fixing software issues. Yet somehow, when it came to AI-generated code, I was expecting perfection. I was critiquing AI agents for not creating flawless architectures or bug-free code, when I've never achieved that standard myself in over 45 years of programming.

The reality is that if you take any group of senior developers and architects, you'll find significant disagreement on almost every aspect of software development. Some swear by clean code principles, others believe they lead to over-abstraction. Some are passionate about test-driven development, while others see it as unnecessary overhead. Some believe functional programming is inherently superior to object-oriented approaches, while others argue the opposite. Pick any development practice or architectural pattern, and you'll find respected experts on both sides of the debate.

My current development team doesn't even write code the same way I would, and that's perfectly fine. What matters is that the code meets the requirements, follows agreed-upon standards, and can be maintained and extended over time. The same principles apply to AI-generated code. I am responsible for whatever work product is developed, and I need to ensure it aligns with the project goals and quality standards.

## Holding onto What Works

While my role has evolved significantly, I haven't abandoned the practices that have served me well throughout my career. The fundamentals of good software development remain just as important when working with AI agents as they were when working with human teams.

Frequent code check-ins and version control are still essential. Working from an agreed-upon task list and clear requirements is still critical for project success. Creating comprehensive test frameworks to validate functionality and catch regressions is still a cornerstone of reliable software development. These practices have proven their value over decades of software development, regardless of who or what is writing the code.

What's changed is how I apply these practices. Instead of writing tests myself, I'm directing AI agents to create comprehensive test suites. Instead of manually managing task lists, I'm using AI to help break down complex requirements into manageable chunks. Instead of personally implementing every feature, I'm reviewing AI-generated implementations to ensure they meet our quality standards and architectural guidelines.

The tools have evolved, but the underlying principles of good software development remain constant.

## Setting the Quality Bar

Perhaps the most important aspect of my evolved role is establishing and maintaining quality standards. Just as I would with a human development team, I set clear expectations for code quality, documentation, testing coverage, and architectural consistency. The difference is that AI agents are remarkably good at meeting whatever standards you establish, as long as you're clear and consistent about what those standards are.

This means being explicit about coding conventions, architectural patterns, and testing requirements. It means providing feedback when the AI deviates from established patterns and reinforcing good practices when the AI gets things right. It means being willing to reject work that doesn't meet the quality bar and providing specific guidance on how to improve it.

In many ways, this is more demanding than traditional code review because you're not just catching bugs or suggesting improvements - you're actively training your AI agents to understand and internalize your quality standards.

## Looking Forward

As I reflect on this evolution, I'm struck by how much my perspective on AI's role in software development has changed. What started as skepticism about AI's capabilities has evolved into a new model of development that leverages the strengths of both human judgment and AI productivity.

The key insight has been recognizing that AI doesn't need to replace human developers - it needs to augment human capabilities in ways that allow us to focus on higher-level concerns like architecture, requirements analysis, and quality assurance. The most effective approach isn't trying to make AI write code exactly like I would, but rather establishing clear standards and letting AI find its own path to meeting those standards.

This journey mirrors many of the career transitions I've experienced over the past 35 years, where evolving technology required me to adapt my role and approach while holding onto the fundamental principles that drive successful outcomes. Just as I learned to transition from individual contributor to team lead to director, I've had to learn how to effectively lead a team that includes AI agents alongside human developers.

The pace of AI evolution shows no signs of slowing down, and I expect my relationship with AI tools will continue to evolve. But the core lesson remains the same: the most successful technologists are those who can adapt their approach to leverage new capabilities while maintaining focus on the outcomes that matter most.

Whether you're just getting started with AI development tools or you've been experimenting for months, I encourage you to step back and evaluate whether your current approach is taking full advantage of what these tools can do today. The AI capabilities available now are significantly more advanced than what we had even six months ago, and the most effective way to use them may be quite different from what worked in the past.
